# bet_crawler
Webcrawler for betting information extraction of tennis matches

General information: Always read robots.txt when crawling a website. Make sure you don't crawl sites which you aren't allowed to crawl.

I would run this crawler on an AWS EC2 instance with phantom js and crontab several times per day. The users of the extracted information asked me not to name the website I would crawl.
